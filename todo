0. Make todo list lol

1. First figure out how to get the L matrix using the preliminary chrome sphere data.
   a. Figure out the frame of reference.
   b. Given one image of a sphere, make a function that determines the normal of the sphere at a
   point.
   c. Now plug R(eflected) and N(ormal) into the L = 2(N*R)... equation and generate the L-matrix
   d. Repeat this process for every chrome sphere image.

2. Perform PS to get surface normals.
   a. Get all the images and do any preprocessing if necessary (to remove vignetting etc.)
   b. Generate two matrices: an L-matrix that is (k by 3) where k is the amount of lights (images),
   and an I-matrix that is (k by p) where p is the amount of pixels in an input picture.
   c. Now using these matrices, generate a G-matrix using the equation given note that you would
   have to use some least squares method since k > 3. That part might be more complicated so figure
   that out
   d. Now split this into albedo and normal vectors.
   e. Create function that maps normal vectors to color based on the specifications (red is x, blue
   is y or something...). Now generate an image of the same size with using this color map.

3. Create a depth map
   a.
